        <h1>Roasted vegetables</h1>
        <img src="https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.media-allrecipes.com%2Fuserphotos%2F8523116.jpg&w=1200&h=678&c=sc&poi=face&q=85">

            These Indian-inspired roasted vegetables have a pop of flavor and a hint of heat from the aromatic
            and well-known Indian spice blend, garam masala.
            If you cannot find garam masala in the international section of your grocery store or ethnic market,
            there are many recipes available online to make your own.
