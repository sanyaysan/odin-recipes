        <p>This addicting air fryer broccoli has charred, crispy edges and is tossed in a sweet, tangy sauce. The extra charred pieces are my favorite part! Even picky eaters will be going back for seconds. This makes an excellent accompaniment for fish or chicken, or served on top of rice</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large head broccoli, stems peeled and sliced 1/4 inch thick, florets separated</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Thai sweet chili sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
